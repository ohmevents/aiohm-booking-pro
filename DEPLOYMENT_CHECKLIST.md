## ⚠️ Before Final Deployment

1. **Run cleanup check**: Access `cleanup_check.php` to check for test orders
2. **Remove test orders**: Delete any test orders found
3. **Delete cleanup_check.php**: Remove this temporary file
4. **Test functionality**: Verify sold-out badges work correctly
5. **Clear all caches**: WordPress cache, object cache, CDN cache
6. **Backup database**: Create a backup before deployment

## 📋 Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Frontend Test**:
   - Create a real booking
   - Mark order as paid in admin
   - Verify sold-out badge appears when capacity reached
   
2. **Admin Test**:
   - Check Events Overview shows correct "Total Sold" numbers
   - Verify only paid orders are counted
   
3. **Performance Check**:
   - Verify no debug output in browser console
   - Check page load times

## 🚨 Files to Delete Before Final Deployment
- [ ] cleanup_check.php (delete after running)

## 📝 Notes
The sold-out functionality now works correctly by:
- Only counting orders with status = 'paid' 
- Matching event names from order notes to event titles
- Updating both frontend availability and admin overview consistently
